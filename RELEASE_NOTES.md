## 0.4.11 — an app icon

- **A launcher icon.** The app had none. It now shows a white funnel on blue with a green check, the same filter as the status card. It is an adaptive icon, so it fits any launcher's shape, and it has a one-colour layer for Android 13+ themed icons.
- **Offer alerts in the status bar show the funnel** instead of a generic system symbol.

Evidence boundaries: the icon was rendered and reviewed under round, squircle and square masks, as a themed icon, and at launcher size. Simulated Android 8 and 15 tests check that the app declares it, that it has the themed layer, and that alerts use the funnel. How your phone's launcher shows it was not seen here.
